# Pygame Flappy Bird with NEAT: A Neural Network Experiment

## Inspiration

I wanted to experiment with neural networks in a way that offered visual feedback. This project, following a tutorial, provided a perfect opportunity to build and train an AI to play Flappy Bird.  The visual nature of the game made it ideal for observing the neural network's learning process.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.  You can download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install the required libraries: `pygame` and `neat`.  Use pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame neat
   ```

3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VanshAnand1/pygame-flappy-bird-with-neat
   ```

4. Navigate to the repository directory and run the game:
   ```bash
   cd pygame-flappy-bird-with-neat
   python3 main.py
   ```
